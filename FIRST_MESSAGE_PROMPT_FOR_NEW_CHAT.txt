=== COPY EVERYTHING BELOW THIS LINE AND PASTE AS FIRST MESSAGE IN YOUR NEW PROJECT'S CHAT ===

Read the file AI_CONTEXT_FOR_NEW_PROJECT.md in this project (it's in the root). Use it as context for our whole conversation.

Summary you should remember:
- This is my own version of a full-stack healthcare web app (React + Node/Express + MySQL). I differentiated it from a peer's project (rebrand, rename, add/remove features).
- Stack: React (TypeScript), Tailwind, Axios, React Query, React Hook Form, JWT auth. API base URL from env, usually http://localhost:5000/api.
- Roles: patient, doctor, admin. API returns { success, data }. Auth via useAuth() and Bearer token.
- When I ask to add something or "bring from the reference project", implement it HERE in this workspace using this stack and structure. Don't assume another project is open.
- I may have customized app name and role names (e.g. Doctor → Dentist); check AI_CONTEXT_FOR_NEW_PROJECT.md section 7 if I've filled it in.

From now on, implement any feature or fix I ask for in this project only, following these patterns. Confirm you've read the context and are ready.
